**Type:** Governance / CI / SEO safety

**Scope:** Repository operations only; no public page content or URL changes

**Changed URLs:** None

**What changed:** Added site-specific operating rules, scope approval, URL baseline, keyword ownership map and automated Pull Request checks.

**Why:** Prevent mistaken instructions or broad edits from damaging builds, indexed URLs, SEO signals or inquiry paths.

**URL mapping:** None

**Rollback point:** `105c1ac`

**Verification:** Scope guard passed; negative out-of-scope test was blocked; ESLint passed; 128-page production build passed; current production baseline verification passed. Preview network failures now produce a clear blocking result instead of an unhandled exception. Vercel Preview validation remains required before merge.
